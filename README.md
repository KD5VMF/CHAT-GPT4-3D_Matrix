# CHAT-GPT4-3D_Matrix
3D graphical representation of a matrix multiplication algorithm.

This Python program provides a command-line interface for users to generate two random matrices, perform matrix multiplication, and visualize the resulting matrix in a 3D plot.

The program consists of several parts:

1. **Import Statements**: These statements load the necessary modules for the program. The `numpy` module is used for numerical computations and the creation and manipulation of arrays and matrices. The `matplotlib.pyplot` and `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` modules are used for creating the 3D visualization of the matrices.

2. **Function Definitions**: The program contains several function definitions, each of which performs a specific task.

    - `visualize_matrix`: This function accepts a matrix as input and creates a 3D scatter plot to visualize the matrix. It creates a new figure and a 3D subplot using matplotlib. The x and y coordinates are generated using numpy's `meshgrid` function, and the z coordinates are the values of the matrix. These coordinates are then used to create a 3D scatter plot.
  
    - `get_matrix_size`: This function provides an interactive prompt for the user to specify the size of the matrices. It presents the user with a list of valid matrix sizes (ranging from 2x2 up to 20x20, in steps of 2) and asks the user to enter a selection. If the user enters an invalid selection, the function will keep asking until a valid selection is made.

    - `generate_matrices`: This function accepts an integer as input and generates two random matrices of the specified size using numpy's `random.rand` function.

    - `multiply_matrices`: This function accepts two matrices as input and returns the result of their multiplication using numpy's `dot` function.

3. **Main Program**: The main part of the program executes the functions in the correct order. It first calls `get_matrix_size` to ask the user for the size of the matrices, then it calls `generate_matrices` to create two random matrices of that size. Next, it calls `multiply_matrices` to multiply the two matrices together, and it finally calls `visualize_matrix` to visualize the resulting matrix.

    The main program also prints out the two original matrices and the resulting matrix to the console, so the user can see the values before they are visualized.

4. **Program Execution**: The bottom part of the program is a standard Python idiom for specifying that the main part of the program should only be run if the file is being executed as a script (as opposed to being imported as a module). When you run the script directly (e.g., by typing `python scriptname.py` at the command line), Python sets the special variable `__name__` to `"__main__"`. Therefore, the condition `if __name__ == "__main__":` is only true if the script is being run directly. If the file is being imported into another script, that condition is false, so the main part of the program is not run.

That's a high-level overview of the program. It showcases several key features of Python, including function definitions, user interaction, exception handling, matrix operations, and data visualization. It's a great example of how Python can be used for numerical computations and scientific visualization.
